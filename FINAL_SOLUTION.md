# ✅ FINAL SOLUTION - Analytics Agent is NOW WORKING!

## 🎉 Problem SOLVED!

The analytics agent now successfully processes tasks and returns results!

---

## 🔍 What Was The REAL Problem?

### Root Cause:
The A2A Server was **missing the `task_status` handler**!

When the Full Agent App tried to poll for task status, the A2A server responded with:
```
"Unknown message type: task_status"
```

This meant the UI could never get the task completion status, causing timeouts.

---

## ✅ The Fix:

### 1. Added `get_task_status()` method to A2A Server
```python
async def get_task_status(self, task_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    if task_id not in self.tasks:
        return {"status": "error", "message": f"Task {task_id} not found"}
    
    task = self.tasks[task_id]
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "task": {
            "task_id": task.task_id,
            "status": task.status,  # pending, in_progress, completed, failed
            "result": task.result
        }
    }
```

### 2. Added `task_status` message handler
```python
elif message_type == "task_status":
    result = await self.get_task_status(data.get("task_id"))
    return json.dumps(result)
```

### 3. Modified Full Agent App to poll for status
- Increased timeout from 5 to 15 seconds
- Changed to poll every 0.5 seconds instead of waiting for push notifications
- Queries task status using the new `task_status` message type

## 🚀 Your System is NOW FULLY WORKING!

### Test Results:
```
[OK] Analytics Agent found: Analytics Agent
[OK] Task delegated with ID: 8affc39d-feb0-4653-bf3a-fdeea09ad118
Poll 1: Task status = in_progress
Poll 2: Task status = completed
[SUCCESS] Task completed!
Result: {Analytics data with trends, recommendations, etc.}
```
