## 📊 What You'll See Now:

### Before (Raw JSON):
```json
{
  "tickets_analyzed": 150,
  "trend_analysis": "Network issues showing 15% increase",
  "top_categories": ["Network", "Email", "Hardware"],
  "priority_distribution": {"High": 25, "Medium": 60, "Low": 15},
  "recommendations": [
    "Focus on network infrastructure improvements",
    "Consider additional email support resources",
    "Monitor hardware failure patterns"
  ]
}
```

### After (Natural Language):

📊 Analytics Agent Response

Based on my analysis of the tickets assigned to Michael, here's what I found:

I've reviewed 150 tickets and discovered some interesting patterns. The most notable 
trend is that network issues are on the rise - we're seeing about a 15% increase 
compared to previous periods.

Looking at the categories, the top three areas generating tickets are Network issues 
(which makes sense given the trend), followed by Email problems and Hardware-related 
requests.

When it comes to priority distribution, the majority of tickets (60%) are classified 
as Medium priority, which is pretty standard. However, we do have 25% marked as High 
priority that need immediate attention, while 15% are Low priority items that can be 
handled as time allows.

Based on these insights, here are my recommendations:

1. **Focus on network infrastructure improvements** - With the 15% increase in network 
   issues, it would be wise to investigate what's causing these problems and address 
   the root cause.

2. **Consider additional email support resources** - Email is showing up as a top 
   category, so you might want to evaluate if your email support team needs more help.

3. **Monitor hardware failure patterns** - Keep an eye on hardware issues to see if 
   there's a pattern that could indicate aging equipment or specific components that 
   need attention.

Let me know if you'd like me to dive deeper into any of these areas!
